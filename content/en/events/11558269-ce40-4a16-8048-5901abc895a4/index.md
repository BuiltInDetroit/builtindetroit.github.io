The ability to design and development motion control systems is an essential part of any machine or industrial process - as all machines must move in some way to perform useful work.

These days, such motion systems often consist of very powerful, but complex, programmable controllers, drives and servo motors.

If you are interested in designing real industrial machinery or robotics, detailed knowledge of these topics are essential.

In this presentation, we will touch on the following:

- Brief history of motion control.
- Overview of common motion control system architectures.
- Mechanical and electromechanical design and tradeoffs of various motors.
- Typical positional feedback components and pathways.
- Introduction to control theory and modeling.
- Brief introduction to industrial ethernet and fieldbus (for subsequent events).
