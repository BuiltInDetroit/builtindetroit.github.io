Factory floors and industrial machinery are very complex with some processing high-precision product at very high volumes.

Modern factories are a collection of various industrial computers, sensors, actuators and external data sources.

Factory lines are highly-optimized, but generally, kept open to changes in the future.

Instrumental to this are various programmable controllers and control strategies scattered throughout the floor.

In this presentation, we will touch on the following:

- Brief history of industrial control, equipment and control cabinets.
- An overview of the various programmable controller options and emerging control technologies.
- A quick tour of a very common industrial controller, the Programmable Logic Controller.
- Future pathways that we will explore in subsequent events and workshops.
