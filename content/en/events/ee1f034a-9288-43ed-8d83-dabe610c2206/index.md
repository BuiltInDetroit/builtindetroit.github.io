Industrial automation and robotics have been a key part of manufacturing for decades - and their use is expanding and evolving.

In this presentation, we will touch on the following:

- A brief history of industrial automation starting with the Second World War.
- An overview of the various robot types commonly used and their applications.
- How automation fits into a product life cycle.
- Emerging strategies, technologies and tradeoffs.

In many ways, this presentation will set the tone for further exploration into more low-level details and technical considerations of industrial automation and robotics in future events.
